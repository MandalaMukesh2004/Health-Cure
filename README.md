# Health-Cure
The Health Cure System is a powerful AI-driven web application that enables the detection of seven critical diseases using health scanning reports. By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, the system assists in accurate and efficient disease detection.

# ðŸŒŸ Features

- Covid-19 Detection

- Brain Tumor Detection

- Breast Cancer Detection

- Alzheimer's Detection

- Diabetes Detection

- Pneumonia Detection

- Heart Disease Detection

# ðŸš€ How It Works

- Upload a health scanning report (image or text-based file).
- The system processes the input using trained machine learning models.
- Results are displayed with disease predictions and confidence scores.

# ðŸ’» Technology Stack

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Flask (Python)
- Machine Learning Libraries: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- Other Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Imutils
